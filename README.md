# instagram_web_scraper
Semi automated web scraper. Uses jupyter notebook so some human interaction required
Uses the selenium library and chromium driver
The user will see the page being loaded
Collecting text from each post
Limitations:
  1. not automated and will require human interaction
  2. By.X_Path value may need to be manually changed so inspect the page you want to scrape and ensure you have the correct path for the cells required
  3. A count of iterations is included to prevent scrolling that can go on for a long time
